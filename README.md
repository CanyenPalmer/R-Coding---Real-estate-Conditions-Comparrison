**Project Spotlight: Real Estate Price Modeling in Ames, TX**

As part of a recent applied statistics and modeling project, I developed a predictive model to analyze housing market conditions in Ames, Texas. Using a rich dataset with over **2,300 observations** and **60+ features**, this project focused on identifying the most significant predictors of **home sale prices** through exploratory data analysis and regression modeling.

Key Techniques and Tools:

* **R Programming**: 
Leveraged the `tidyverse` for data wrangling and visualization.
* **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**:
Applied **log-transformation** to normalize skewed response variables and improve linear model fit.
* **Model Selection**: 
Assessed multiple predictors including `foundation`, `condition_1`, `condition_2`, and `sale_condition` using linear regression.
* **Model Evaluation**: 
Used `yardstick::rmse_vec()` to compare prediction accuracy via **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.
Data Handling: 
Interpreted over 60 numeric and categorical predictors including physical features, zoning codes, and home attributes.

Why It Matters:
This project bridges statistical theory with real-world business intelligence. The predictive modeling framework developed here can be extended to:

* Valuation models for residential and commercial real estate.
* Feature selection in complex, multi-variable environments.
* Price optimization and trend forecasting in dynamic markets.

Broader Impact:
This hands-on experience reinforces my ability to:

* Transform raw data into actionable insights.
* Build and validate interpretable machine learning models.
* Communicate technical results to drive decision-makingâ€”skills that are vital in any data science or analytics role
